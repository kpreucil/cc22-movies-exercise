        <p>MovieCo has released some data about all of their rentals in 2014. As a competitor, your job is to go though the data and get some insigts about your competitor!</p>
        <p>Two questions are below, and we've retrieved the data for you... but it's probably not in the format you want. You'll have to go through and get the data to reveal the answers using your newfound skills with arrays, regex, and strings!</p>

            	The variable rentalsArray contains all of the rentals in the format:
            	"Username Movie# Month"

            	For example:
            	"User2 43 March"

            	Which means that "User2" rented movie number 43 (The Pianist) in March. You don't have
            	the list of movie IDs yet - that's for tomorrow's homework!

            	Your job is to answer the two questions:
            	Which user had the most checkouts in 2014?
            	Which month had the most checkouts in 2014?
